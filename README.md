# BAM: Building ANUGA Models 

This repository contains Python scripts for building and running open-source hydrodynamic ANUGA models using publicly available data. More information about ANUGA is available here https://github.com/GeoscienceAustralia/anuga_core


## Installation

Use the BAM.yml file to set up a conda environment with requried packages:
```diff
- conda env create -f BAM.yml 
```

If the installation stalls at "Solving Environment", we recommend using Mamba (https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba) to build the environment. From base environment:

``` diff
- conda install mamba -n base -c conda-forge
- mamba env create -f BAM.yml
```

To activate the new environment:
``` diff
- conda activate BAM
```


## Ancillary Datasets

Several datasets are utilized in this project. Those that cannot be accessed through a Python API must be downloaded manually by the user. Users must populate the BAM/ancillary folder with the files below for the scripts to work. They are too large to be provided through GitHub.

### GEBCO General Bathymetry Charts of the Ocean
> ***Download the files from here: https://www.bodc.ac.uk/data/open_download/gebco/gebco_2022_sub_ice_topo/geotiff/, unzip the file, and move to BAM/ancillary/gebco. There is a vrt file there that will only work with this version of GEBCO.
 - The 2022 global gridded dataset are subset within this project. The global database is large (8GB) and can be slow to download
