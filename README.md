# BAM: Building ANUGA Models 

This repository contains Python scripts for building and running open-source hydrodynamic ANUGA models using publicly available data. More information about ANUGA is available here https://github.com/GeoscienceAustralia/anuga_core


## Installation

Use the BAM.yml file to set up a conda environment with requried packages:
```diff
- conda env create -f BAM.yml 
```

If the installation stalls at "Solving Environment", we recommend using Mamba (https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba) to build the environment. From base environment:

``` diff
- conda install mamba -n base -c conda-forge
- mamba env create -f BAM.yml
```

To activate the new environment:
``` diff
- conda activate BAM
```


## Ancillary Datasets

Several datasets are utilized in this project. Those that cannot be accessed through a Python API must be downloaded manually by the user.

### GEBCO General Bathymetry Charts of the Ocean
